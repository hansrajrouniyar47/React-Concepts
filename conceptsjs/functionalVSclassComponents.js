//Functional Components
// simple functions
//use func components as much as possible
//absence of 'this' keyword
//solution without using state
//mainly responsible for UI
//stateless/dumb/presentational

//class components
//more feature rich
//maintain their own private -state
//complex UI logic
//provide lifecycle hooks
//stateful/smart/container

//but with updates in react, state and hooks can be used with functional components as well.

//in functional component you pass props as parameter to function and later with its value as say props.name or props.value, you can use of that
//in class component you do not have any parameters to pass that way
//therefore what you do is
//you have reserved keyword in class component which is this.props and you work this way only
